# [@Necromanser](https://replit.com/@Necromanser)'s Final Comment:

I've been using this platform for several years, I've learned everything I know about computer science with this as my primary IDE because of how convenient it is, and I miss the old repl.it, the place where one could find some of the brightest minds working on projects and seek inspiration. Not every project was perfect, but they all had value, and replit as a company used to be there to support that. I feel like they're going a different direction now and nothing will change that.
