# The Last Comments
Over a hundred comments from the users of Replit. 

This project is by @Classified3D of replit. I moved it to glitch.

**Explanation**
Back in early 2024/late 2023, Replit removed comments, disconnecting the community. Right before they went away, Classified3D created a project to store all of the last comments from the community. The folder called "finalcomments" is the exact same from the repl, viewable [here](https://replit.com/@Classfied3D/Make-your-final-comment).
