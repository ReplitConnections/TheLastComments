# [@Imlonely4ever](https://replit.com/@Imlonely4ever)'s Final Comment:

As a programming environment, Replit's mission is to offer users a platform for writing, testing, and deploying code. But this mission is heavily reliant on comments. Comments are essential for providing explanation, context, and instruction to code. They are a crucial element in the development process for programmers, both experienced and novice.

The removal of comments from Replit will have serious consequences for developers' ability to understand and edit code. This change will not only make it more difficult for users to read and understand code, but it will also make it more challenging to fix bugs and add new features to existing projects. This will slow down the development process and potentially lead to more errors, due to the lack of explanation and context provided by comments.

In addition, this change will also create a major inconvenience for users who have already written code with comments on Replit. They will have to either remove all of their comments or find another platform to deploy their code, which will be time-consuming and frustrating. This will cause a significant loss of user trust in the platform.

It is understandable that Replit is trying to manage its resources, but this is not the way to go about it. Removing comments will not significantly reduce storage space and will not have a significant impact on Replit's sustainability. The impact on the overall user experience, however, will be immense. Users will have to deal with the loss of a valuable tool that helps them write, understand, and fix code.

Replit should reconsider this change and understand the implications it will have on its users. The loss of comments will significantly impact the development process for programmers and create a lot of inconvenience for existing users. It is important to understand that a programming environment's mission includes providing users with a platform for writing, testing, and deploying code, which includes comments. Replit should focus on managing resources in a way that does not impact the overall user experience and the mission of the platform. The removal of comments from Replit will not only affect the experience of experienced programmers, but also of new learners and students. Comments can help new programmers understand the code they are working with, and can provide guidance on how to improve their code. Without comments, new programmers may find it more difficult to develop their coding skills, which can hinder their growth as developers.

While Replit may be able to save some storage space by removing comments, the impact on the user experience will likely be much greater. Comments are a crucial part of code readability, and without them, code can become much harder to understand, debug, and maintain. This could lead to more bugs, longer development times, and potentially even security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the removal of comments could have a negative impact on user retention. If users feel like Replit is no longer providing them with the tools they need to develop code, they may be more likely to switch to a different platform. This could result in a loss of revenue for Replit, as well as a hit to its reputation.

It is important for Replit to understand that the development of code is a collaborative process, and that comments are a crucial part of that process. By removing comments, Replit is limiting the ability of developers to collaborate effectively and efficiently. This could lead to increased development times and potentially even lost revenue as a result.

In order to ensure the long-term success of the platform, Replit should focus on finding ways to manage resources that do not impact the overall user experience or the mission of the platform. This could include exploring other options for reducing storage space, or finding ways to optimize the use of existing resources.

In conclusion, the removal of comments from Replit is not a sustainable or effective solution to the issue of resource management. The negative impact on the user experience and the development process will outweigh any potential benefits in storage space. Replit should reconsider this change and focus on finding alternative solutions to manage its resources that do not impact the experience of developers who use the platform.
